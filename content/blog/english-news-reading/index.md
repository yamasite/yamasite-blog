April 15 (Reuters) - Russia has confirmed the Moskva missile cruiser, the flagship of its Black Sea Fleet, has sunk while being towed to port following what it said was a fire and explosions involving ammunition stowed onboard.

四月 15 日（路透社）- 俄罗斯已经证实，黑海舰队的旗舰——莫斯科号导弹巡洋舰在被拖行至港口时，由于船上的弹药燃烧爆炸导致沉没。

> Reuters 把本该翻译成 Moscow 的船名直接俄语音译为 Moskva。不清楚是错误还是有意为之？如果音译成 Moskva，确实可以和首都 Moscow 区别开来。

Ukraine says the Moskva's fate was sealed by a missile strike launched by its forces from the coast which ripped open the hulking Soviet-era ship's hull. Russia's defence ministry has not confirmed that version of events. Reuters is unable to verify either side's assertions.

乌克兰称，莫斯科号的沉没是因为乌军从海岸发射的导弹击穿了这艘前苏联时代的巨大船体。乌克兰的说法并未得到俄罗斯国防部的证实。对于双方的说法，路透社均无法证实。

Here's what we do know, and what the sinking means (and does not mean) for Russia's battle-readiness:

下面是我们已知的事实，还有莫斯科号的沉没对俄罗斯的战争状态的影响：

WHAT CAPABILITIES DOES THE SINKING DEPRIVE RUSSIA OF?

这次沉没削弱了俄罗斯的哪些能力？

Russia has powerful air defence systems deployed in Crimea, which it seized from Ukraine in 2014, but the Moskva was able to provide long-range and mobile air defence protection for the entire Black Sea Fleet and was a floating command and control centre. Its loss degrades the fleet's air defences, particularly on longer range missions.

自 2014 年从乌克兰手中夺取克里米亚以来，俄罗斯在克里米亚部署了强大的防空系统。但是莫斯科号可以为整个黑海舰队提供远程、机动的防空能力，而且是海上的指挥控制中心。莫斯科号的沉没削弱了黑海舰队的防空能力，尤其对于远程防空任务来说更是如此。

The ship had a crew of around 500 sailors who Russia said were successfully evacuated to other ships before being returned to their home port of Sevastopol in Crimea on Friday. Ukraine has suggested there are likely to have been fatalities, but Russia has not said anything on the subject yet.

莫斯科号拥有约 500 名船员。俄罗斯称所有船员都撤离到了其他船只，并于周五返回位于克里米亚的塞瓦斯托波尔母港。乌克兰称莫斯科号可能有伤亡，但俄罗斯并未提及伤亡情况。

Unlikely to, but Britain's Ministry of Defence says its loss is likely to prompt Russia to review its naval posture in the Black Sea. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that while the sinking would have a symbolic impact and potentially raise questions about Russia's longer-term naval capabilities, it would be unlikely to have a major impact on the course of the conflict. The Russian navy has so far not played a big role.

虽然不太可能，但英国国防部称，莫斯科号的沉没可能会让俄罗斯重新审视自己在黑海的海军地位。一位匿名的美国官员称，莫斯科号的沉没虽然会造成象征意义上的影响，并可能让外界质疑俄罗斯海军的后续实力，但不太可能对冲突的进程造成重大影响。俄罗斯海军并没有在其中扮演重要角色。

One U.S. official said that Russia had only used its warships in a limited fashion, to carry out occasional strikes and resupply troops in the south. Russia retains naval dominance in the immediate region and the Moskva was equipped to destroy enemy vessels at sea but little is left of Ukraine's navy.

一名美国官员称，俄罗斯仅仅在有限程度上使用海军进行少量的攻击和补给南方部队的任务。俄罗斯在原地区仍具有海军绝对优势。虽然莫斯科号用于摧毁敌军战舰，但乌克兰海军已经所剩无几。

Yes it will, but that change is not seen as being hugely significant. After the fire on the Moskva started, which U.S. officials believe was likely a Ukrainian attack, about five Russian warships in the northern part of the Black Sea moved further away from the coast, about 80 nautical miles. But U.S. officials said they believed those ships were still capable of carrying out strikes into Ukraine from that distance and were less likely to be targeted by the Ukrainians that far away from the coast. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington-based think tank, said the Ukrainian military’s ability to hit Russian warships in the Black Sea could force the Russian Navy to deploy additional air defence and other assets for protection.

莫斯科号的沉没并没有带来非常巨大的影响。莫斯科号上起火之后（美国官员认为可能是乌方的袭击），约五艘位于黑海北部的俄罗斯战舰与海岸的距离增加了约 80 海里。但美国官员称，他们认为这些战舰仍然可以从当前距离对乌克兰发动攻击，而且更不容易被乌克兰从海岸攻击。位于华盛顿的智库，战争研究机构（ISW），称由于乌军具备从海岸攻击黑海中的俄军战舰的能力，俄海军可能被迫部署更多防空力量或其他资产用于保护舰队。

Not clear, but some analysts say it may have helped support a possible Russian amphibious landing in the Ukrainian port of Odesa that has not happened yet because of resistance from Ukrainian forces. Its sinking may be seen in some quarters in Ukraine as reducing the chances of such an assault and allow Ukraine to redeploy some of its forces elsewhere.

有些分析人士认为，莫斯科号也许支持了一次俄罗斯针对乌克兰侧敖德萨港口的两栖登陆行动。由于乌军抵抗，行动没有付诸实施。对于乌方部分人士看来，莫斯科号的沉没降低了类似登陆行动的可能性，乌克兰因此会把军队部署到其他地方。

No. Russia has two other ships of the same class, the Marshal Ustinov and the Varyag, which serve with Russia's Northern and Pacific fleets respectively. Turkey, which controls access to the Black Sea via the Bosphorus, will not let them enter at a time of war.

俄罗斯还拥有另外两艘同级别的战舰，乌斯提诺夫上将号和瓦良格号，分别在俄罗斯的北方舰队和太平洋舰队服役。土耳其通过伊斯坦堡海峡控制黑海入口，不会在战时让俄罗斯舰队进入。

No. It had anti-ship missiles and surface-to-air missiles, but was not equipped with Russia's latest generation Kalibr cruise missiles or hypersonic missiles.

莫斯科号装备了反舰导弹和地对空导弹，但并未装备俄罗斯最新的 “口径” 巡航导弹或超音速导弹。

Not very. Designed in the 1970s Soviet Union during the Cold War, it was conceived to destroy U.S. aircraft carriers and had been in service for nearly four decades. It underwent an extensive refit, and according to Britain's Ministry of Defence, only returned to operational status in 2021. Despite that refit, some of its hardware remained outdated.

莫斯科号由前苏联在冷战期间的二十世纪七十年代设计，初衷是用来摧毁美国的航空母舰。莫斯科号已经服役了将近四十年，经历过从头到尾的改造。据英国国防部称，莫斯科号在 2021 年才恢复作战状态。尽管经历过改造，一些硬件仍然处于过时状态。

It's a bitter loss for the Russian military as the ship, though ageing, was a symbol of the Crimea-based Black Sea Fleet and of Russian military pride. If it was holed by Ukrainian anti-ship missiles, it would be the biggest Russian warship to be lost in action since 1941, when German dive bombers crippled the Soviet battleship Marat in Kronshtadt harbour. The sinking, whether by Ukrainian missile strikes or through a mishap, “is a major propaganda victory for Ukraine,” said an assessment by the ISW. Western diplomats and experts expect senior officers in the Black Sea Fleet to lose their jobs over the sinking.

这对于俄军是一次惨痛的失败。莫斯科号，虽然老旧，依然是克里米亚黑海舰队和俄军的荣耀象征。如果莫斯科号真的是被乌克兰的反舰导弹所击穿，那将会是 1941 年以来俄军损失的最大战舰。1941 年，德军俯冲轰炸机在克龙斯塔德港口重创了苏联马拉特号战列舰。莫斯科号的沉没，无论是被乌克兰导弹击沉还是由于火灾沉没，ISW 的评估认为“都是乌克兰宣传战的重大胜利”。西方的外交官和专家们预测，黑海舰队的高级军官会因沉没事件遭遇撤职。
